Segmentation is the process of finding the boundaries of various tissues and Image Segmentation plays a vital role in medical imaging applications.
In this project I've used U-Net architecture which is one of the popular architectures for segmentation.
## Dataset
Brain MRI segmentation (LGG Segmentation Dataset): https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation <br>
This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
